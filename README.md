# GOCHECK - Pre-Commit Hook for Sensitive Information

GOCHECK is a Git pre-commit hook written in Go, designed to scan staged files for sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, certificates, and Client Identifying Data (CID) like emails or names. If sensitive data is found, the commit will be halted and the user will be given the option to either abort or force the commit.

## Features
- Scans staged files for sensitive data including:
  - API tokens, bearer tokens, and secrets.
  - Passwords.
  - Certificates (e.g., SSL certificates or private keys).
  - Client Identifying Data (CID) such as emails and names.
- Offers an interactive prompt to decide whether to proceed with the commit if sensitive data is detected.
- Optionally, force commit via command-line flag.

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: Make sure Go is installed. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **Git**: This program is designed to be used as a pre-commit hook in a Git environment.

## Installation

1. **Build the Go Program**:

First, clone or download the project to your local machine, then build the Go executable.



## Build the Go executable
   ```bash
   go build -o precommit.exe
   ```

This will generate the precommit.exe binary in the project directory.

2. Set Up the Git Pre-Commit Hook:

To use this tool as a Git pre-commit hook, follow these steps:

- 1. Navigate to your local Git repository:

```bash
cd path/to/your/git/repository
```
- 2. Create a pre-commit hook file inside the .git/hooks/ directory (if it doesn't already exist):

bash
Copy code
touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
Add the following script to the .git/hooks/pre-commit file:

sh
Copy code
#!/bin/sh
# Run the Go pre-commit tool
echo "Running GOCHECK pre-commit hook..."

# Ensure input is taken from terminal
exec < /dev/tty 'C:/Users/Cedric/Documents/csv2avro/precommit.exe'
Adjust the path to the precommit.exe to match the location where you've built the executable.

Commit the Hook Script (Optional):

If you'd like to share this pre-commit hook across the team, you can commit the hook as part of your repository by including it in a directory such as scripts/ or hooks/. In this case, your teammates can set it up by copying it to their .git/hooks/ directory.

Ignore the Executable (Optional):

It is a good idea to add the precommit.exe to your .gitignore file so that it doesnâ€™t get committed to the repository.

Add this line to your .gitignore file:

bash
Copy code
precommit.exe
Usage
Once the pre-commit hook is set up, it will automatically run every time you attempt to commit changes to the repository.

Example
bash
Copy code
git add myfile.go
git commit -m "Add new feature"
If GOCHECK detects sensitive information, it will halt the commit and display a message like this:

vbnet
Copy code
Cert found in precommit.go at line 19: "Cert": regexp.MustCompile(`(?i)(-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----|-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)`)
Commit halted due to sensitive information found in 39.2703ms.
To ignore this, press [y] to commit, or press [n] to abort commit:
You can then decide whether to continue or abort the commit.

Force Commit
If you know that the flagged data is not sensitive, you can force the commit by running the following:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "My commit message" --no-verify
Alternatively, you can modify the pre-commit hook script to pass a --force flag to the Go program to force commit despite detected sensitive information:

sh
Copy code
'C:/Users/Cedric/Documents/csv2avro/precommit.exe' --force
Development
If you wish to modify the program or contribute:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://your-repo-url.git
Install dependencies (if needed):

bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
Build the binary:

bash
Copy code
go build -o precommit.exe
Test your changes by running the program directly:

bash
Copy code
./precommit.exe
Contributing
Pull requests and issues are welcome! Please ensure that new code includes tests where appropriate and that the overall functionality of the pre-commit hook remains intact.
